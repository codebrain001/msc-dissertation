(\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence andproduct\n expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings onour\n platform  (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d  or  \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d).  We  connect  consumers  (\u201cRider(s)\u201d)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (\u201cMobility  Driver(s)\u201d)  forridesharing\n services,  and  connect  Riders  and  other  consumers  (\u201cEater(s)\u201d)  with  restaurants,  grocers  and  other  stores  (collectively,  \u201cMerchants\u201d)  with  deliveryservice\n providers  (\u201cCouriers\u201d)  for  meal  preparation,  grocery  and  other  delivery  services.  Riders  and  Eaters  are  collectively  referred  to  as  \u201cend-user(s)\u201d  or\u201cconsumer(s).\u201d\n Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We usethis same network, technology, ope\nrational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Our\n technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, theMiddle East, Africa, and Asia (\nexcluding China and Southeast Asia).Our Segments\nAs\n of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offeringseach address large, fr\nagmented markets.Mobility\nMobility\n refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes,minibuses, or taxis. Mobility \nalso includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.We\n believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharingcategory\n position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates oftotal\n ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in agiven\n region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publiclyavailable information and marketing analytics\n firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region ofthe\n world  where  we  operate.  We  also  participate  in  certain  regions  through  our  minority-owned  affiliates.  At  the  time  of  entering  into  such  transactions,  webelieved\n based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leadingridesharing category po\nsition in its respective market.Delivery\nOur\n Delivery  offering  allows  consumers  to  search  for  and  discover  local  restaurants,  order  a  meal,  and  either  pick-up  at  the  restaurant  or  have  the  mealdelivered\n and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launchedour\n Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Deliveryenables\n Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expandsthe\n pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on ourplatform. In addition to b\nenefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which webelieve\n generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\nDuring\n 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d) in an all-stock transaction.

Together, these elements powermovement from point A to point B.\nMassive Network\nOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers,\n as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip.In\n approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of abutton for millions, and we hope ev\nentually billions, of people.Leading Technology\nWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of ourdeep\n technology  advantage  and  include  demand  prediction,  matching  and  dispatching,  and  pricing  technologies.  Ourtechnologies make it ex\ntremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.Operational Excellence\nOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scaleproducts in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships with\ncities and regulators.\nProduct Expertise\nOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provideplatform\n users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety andtrust.\nWe intend to continue to inv\nest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.We\n believe  that  all  of  these  synergies  serve  the  customer  experience,  enabling  us  to  attract  new  platform  users  and  to  deepen  engagement  with  existingplatform\n users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users. For example,Delivery\n attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December 31, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to ourplatform.\n Additionally,  for  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2021,  consumers  who  used  both  Mobility  and  Delivery  generated  12.6  Trips  per  month  onaverage,\n compared to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. Webelieve that these t\nrends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.With\n our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the UnitedStates as our single cross-pl\natform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priorityservice,\n and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings.

A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with,traditional employm\nent. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain availableto anyone who chooses platform-bas\ned work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.Accessible,\n flexible,  independent  work  has  offered  an  option  for  many  workers  historically  marginalized  from  the  labor  market  and  has  enabled  widegeographic\n coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using anapp to connect with work opportuniti\nes. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generallypatchy\n compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker iseither\n an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. AtUber,\n we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovativeways to address these issues.\n\u2022\nAdvocacy:  We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all workshould\n be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber\u2014and otherapp\n based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples ofour advocacy to preserve f\nlexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\u25e6\nIn  the  United  States,  European  Union,  and  Canada,  we  put  forward  proposals  to  improve  the  quality  of  independent  work,  calling  onpolicymakers,\n platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work\u2014one where having accessto protections and benefi\nts doesn\u2019t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.\u25e6\nIn California, we welcomed the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements for platform companies like Uber to providebenefits, including heal\nthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.\u25e6\nIn the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward. Pursuant tothis\n change, drivers who use Uber\u2019s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paidholiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible. We have also annou\nnced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an evenstronger voice to drivers \nand to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.\u2022\nProtections and benefits:  We  partner  with  leading  insurance  companies  around  the  world  to  pioneer  protections  for  independent  workers,  includingimplementing addition\nal protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22.\u2022\nEarnings:  We  are  continually  developing  new  technology  that  Drivers  can  use  to  acquire  information  that  may  help  them  save  on  costs  and  makeinformed choices about wher\ne and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).\u2022\nProgression:  We  have  partnered  with  Arizona  State  University  to  offer  eligible  Drivers  and  their  family  members  access  to  over  100  undergraduatedegree\n programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship.

We  areinvolved\n in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative\n agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers\n or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist),  rather  than  as  independent  contractors.  We  believe  that  Drivers  are  independent  contractors  because,among other\n things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, andprovide a vehicle to per\nform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.Furthermore, the costs associated with\n defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classificationof Drivers have been and may con\ntinue to be material to our business.In addition, more than 150,000 Drive\nrs in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or13", "start_char_idx": 4269, "end_char_idx": 6935, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea6959dc-db68-4c5c-88d9-578130660b2a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea6959dc-db68-4c5c-88d9-578130660b2a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fdbe6bd3-651d-4904-8b08-aef08f7397b0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "hash": "c64e439f602373f30b12ec13257b9ba2fab795e4b356c2fb2ec73524342f3005", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7b41b9d0-a4e3-4d74-a724-c15636bf9b7d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7cb45ae89fa579c6714db2b1123d4596ffec0e033134fb3a0ee080eab9094941", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority ofthese\n Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $372 million as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, we areinvolved\n in  numerous  legal  proceedings  regarding  the  enforceability  of  arbitration  agreements  entered  into  with  Drivers.  If  we  are  not  successful  in  suchproceedings,\n this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on ourbusiness and financial condi\ntion.Changes\n to foreign,  state, and local laws governing the definition  or classification  of independent  contractors,  or judicial  decisions regarding  independentcontractor\n classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation ofDrivers\n by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs havebrought\n litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California AttorneyGeneral,\n in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,\n and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. InAugust 2020,\n the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors duringthe\n pendency  of  the  lawsuit,  and  while  the  California  Court  of  Appeal  subsequently  affirmed  the  lower  court\u2019s  ruling,  on  April  12,  2021,  the  parties  filed  astipulation to dissolve the \ninjunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.In\n November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms likeours\n for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independentcontractors\n under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation todissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminar\ny injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relatingto periods before the ef\nfective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.We\n face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,alleging\n that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, wemay\n be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicialdecisions,\n we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  we  would  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expensesassociated\n with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, socialsecurity\n contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however,\n we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not haveadequate\n Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majorityof\n the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequentlyhave an adverse effec\nt on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Another\n example  of  a  recent  judicial  decision  relating  to  Driver  classification  is  the  Aslam,  Farrar,  Hoy  and  Mithu  v.

If we are unable to compete effectively in theseindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely i\nmpacted.Our\n platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete arehighly\n fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States andCanada\n from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriersto\n entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity toshift\n to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and othermerchants\n have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume oforders; and shippers and car\nriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.Further,\n while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona\n limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan\n we  do.  As  we  and  our  competitors  introduce  new  products  and  offerings,  and  as  existing  products  evolve,  we  expect  to  become  subject  to  additionalcompetition.\n In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, andcarriers\n value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products. Increased competitioncould\n result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of ourplatform, and our margins.\nWe face competit\nion in each of our offerings, including:\u2022\nMobility .

We\n have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter.

We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentivesand\n consumer  discounts  and  promotions  in  these  large  metropolitan  areas.  As  a  result  of  our  geographic  concentration,  our  business  and  financial  results  aresusceptible\n to  economic,  social,  weather,  and  regulatory  conditions  or  other  circumstances  in  each  of  these  large  metropolitan  areas.  Outbreaks  of  contagiousdiseases\n or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas inwhich we operate. Any short-term o\nr long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemicsor\n pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition,or\n regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greaterdegree than\n would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affectour\n ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renewexisting\n licenses  or  do  not  receive  new  licenses  in  key  metropolitan  areas  where  we  operate  or  such  licenses  are  terminated,  any  inability  to  operate  in  suchmetropolitan\n area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operatingresults.\nIn\n addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap onthe\n number  of  new  vehicle  licenses  issued  to  drivers  who  offer  for-hire  services.  In  December  2018,  New  York  City  implemented  a  per-mile  and  per-minuteminimum trip payment \nformula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers\n on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financialperformance\n in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharingtrips\n in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. In addition, other jurisdictions such as Seattle havepassed, or\n may consider or pass regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providingservices\n on our platform. Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network issmaller\n and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetratingsuburban\n and  rural  areas,  or  if  we  are  unable  to  operate  in  certain  key  metropolitan  areas  in  the  future,  our  ability  to  serve  what  we  consider  to  be  our  totaladdressable market would be \nlimited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.In 2021,\n we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport.

We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomousvehicles\n present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon hasacquired),\n Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect thatthey\n will  use  such  technology  to  further  compete  with  us  in  the  mobility,  delivery,  or  logistics  industries.  Waymo  has  already  introduced  a  commercializedridehailing\n fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offerautonomous\n vehicles  on  our  platform  through  our  commercial  agreement  with  Aurora  or  other  partners.  In  the  event  that  our  competitors  bring  autonomousvehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their tech\nnology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of partieswith\n which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, whichwould\n adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providingridesharing,\n delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available toconsumers\n on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors\u2019 offerings over ours, our financial performance and prospectswould be adversely impacted.\nAutonomous vehicle technologies \ninvolve significant risks and liabilities.

If  we  are  unable  to  attract  and  retain  high-quality  management  and  operating  personnel,  ourbusiness, financial condit\nion, and operating results could be adversely affected.The impact of economic conditions, inc\nluding the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.Our\n performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact ondiscretionary consumer spending include general economic condition\ns, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgagemarkets,\n taxation,  energy  prices,  interest  rates,  consumer  confidence,  and  other  macroeconomic  factors.  Consumer  preferences  tend  to  shift  to  lower-costalternatives\n during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to useone\n of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or publictransportation\n alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidityand\n may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of themerchants\n in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchasesfrom merchants is gene\nrally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending atmany\n of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our productsand\n offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional oralternative opportuni\nties for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inf\nlation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.Factors\n such  as  inflation,  increased  fuel  prices,  and  increased  vehicle  purchase,  rental,  or  maintenance  costs,  including  increased  prices  of  new  and  usedvehicle\n parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, may increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform.Similarly,\n factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  food  costs,  increased  labor  and  employee  benefit  costs,  increased  rental  costs,  and  increased  energy  costs  mayincrease merchant\n operating costs, particularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs arebeyond the\n control of these parties. In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or toseek\n alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likelycause\n order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipmentson\n our platform to decline. A decreased supply of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers  on our platform would decrease our network liquidity,which could harm our business and oper\nating results.If\n we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietaryor confidential data, employee da\nta, or platform user data, we may face loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.We\n collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers\u2019 licensenumbers\n and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information.

This  percentage  may  increase  in  the  future,  particularly  in  the  markets  in  which  Careem  operates.  The  use  of  cash  in  connection  with  ourtechnology\n raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash forridesharing\n and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significantfines\n and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use ofcash\n with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent orfatal attacks, and other\n criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers whileusing\n our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which couldadversely impact our busin\ness.In\n addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and maycontinue\n to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit thecash\n received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are notalways\n effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and wecannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Furt\nher, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect toa\n variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systemsfail,\n we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Suchcollection\n failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate,impact our financial performance.\nLoss or material modification of our cr\nedit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.In 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by eithe\nr credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantlylimit\n our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry(\u201cPCI\u201d) and Data Security Standard\n (the \u201cStandard\u201d). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developedby the\n PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and othernetwork\n operating rules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the payment cardnetwork\n rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities mayreveal\n that  we  have  failed  to  comply  with  the  Standard.  If  an  audit,  self-  assessment,  or  other  test  determines  that  we  need  to  take  steps  to  remediate  anydeficiencies,\n such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition,even if we comply with the Standa\nrd, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach.

Some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open sourcesoftware to make available\n all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ practices designedto monitor our\n compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete opensource\n license review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicableterms\n of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract.

If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publiclyrelease certain po\nrtions of our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.In\n addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-source\n licensors  generally  do  not  provide  warranties  or  controls  on  the  functionality  or  origin  of  the  software.

If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collectingthe payment will be requi\nred to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.Additionally, the taxing autho\nrities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies forvaluing developed technology, whic\nh could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our futureincome\n taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated injurisdictions\n that have higher  statutory  tax rates,  changes in the valuation  allowance  on our U.S. and Netherlands'  deferred  tax assets, or changes  in tax laws,regulations, or accounting p\nrinciples. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well as foreign tax authorities, andcurrently\n face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our financialposition\n and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment byour management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertai\nn. The ultimate tax outcome may differ fromthe amounts\n recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Ourtax\n positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future,which\n could  impact  our  financial  position.  In  addition,  in  connection  with  any  planned  or  future  acquisitions,  we  may  acquire  businesses  that  have  differinglicenses\n and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm\u2019s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than ourlicenses\n and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certainjurisdictions\n or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financialstatements, and could adve\nrsely affect our financial results.Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely aff\nect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.We\n are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017, and modified in2020,\n has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation and regulations promulgated in connection therewith remainunclear\n in  many  respects  and  could  be  subject  to  potential  amendments  and  technical  corrections,  as  well  as  interpretations  and  incremental  implementingregulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the\n \u201cIRS\u201d), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. Inaddition,\n it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxableincome as a starting poi\nnt for computing state and local tax liabilities.We\n are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on ourbusiness.\n Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liabilitythat\n we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rateswhere we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stock\nholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance.

For example, in January2019,\n we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked\n up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented\n a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew\n York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulationshave\n had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted\n to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle\n licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. InAugust\n 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruisingcap,\u201d\n intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although\n such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, inNovember 2019, a ballot measur\ne to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effecton\n January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. Inaddition,\n in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January1,\n 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers tonegotiate\n for minimum wages while providing services on our platform.

In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to ceaseoperations\n altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that ourbusiness\n operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers whoused\n the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legalchallenges\n and possible policy solutions.

In  response,  we  appealed  the  decision,  made  certain  changes  to  our  Mobility  products  in  Colombia  and  re-launchedMobility in\n Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, incertain\n of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products andofferings\n or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations.

Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the futurecontinue\n to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decisionas\n a  gesture  of  goodwill  to  pay  the  fines  on  behalf  of  Drivers  or  to  pay  Drivers\u2019  defense  costs,  which,  in  the  aggregate,  can  be  in  the  millions  of  dollars.Furthermore,\n such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and couldadversely\n affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, thathave\n favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehiclecertifications. In\n addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surgepricing\n with respect to our Mobility offering.

The UK represented approximately 8.3% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in 2021.In\n addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contestthe\n application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platformusers,\n including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws relatedto,\n among  other  things,  transportation,  competition,  advertising,  consumer  protection,  fee  calculations,  personal  injuries,  privacy,  intellectual  property,  productliability,\n discrimination, safety, and employment.

The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegatio\nns, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result infinancial\n damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, whichcould\n harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business,revenue, and operating resu\nlts.In\n addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access todockless e-bikes and e-scooters throug\nh our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our otherMobility, Delivery\n and Freight offerings.

Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claimsof\n anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices aretoo\n high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions onour\n business,  other  jurisdictions  may  follow.  Further,  any  new  requirements  or  restrictions,  or  proposed  requirements  or  restrictions,  could  result  in  adversepublicity or fines, whether o\nr not valid or subject to appeal.In\n addition,  governmental  agencies  and  regulators  may,  among  other  things,  prohibit  future  acquisitions,  divestitures,  or  combinations  we  plan  to  make,impose\n significant  fines or penalties,  require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions  that limit or require  us to modify our operations,including\n limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.

In some countries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed asa\n payment  services  provider.  Were  local  regulators  to  determine  that  such  arrangements  require  us  to  be  so  licensed,  such  regulators  may  block  payments  toDrivers,\n merchants, shippers or carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantialdelay in payments we make in \ncertain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users wit\nh payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject toStrong\n Customer Authentication (\u201cSCA\u201d) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticateeach\n payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make ourplatform\n user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use ourplatform\n or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,and\n prospects.  Further,  as  a  result  of  implementing  SCA,  many  payment  transactions  on  our  platform  may  fail  to  be  authenticated  due  to  platform  users  notcompleting\n all  necessary  authentication  steps.  Thus,  in  some  cases,  we  may  not  receive  payment  from  consumers  in  advance  of  paying  Drivers  for  servicesreceived\n by those users. A substantial  increase  in the frequency  with which we make Driver payments  without having received  corresponding  payments fromconsumers could adversely a\nffect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.In\n addition,  laws  related  to  money  transmission  and  online  payments  are  evolving,  and  changes  in  such  laws  could  affect  our  ability  to  provide  paymentprocessing\n on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all.

The EU adopted the GDP\nR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements forcontrollers\n and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use ofpersonal\n data,  strengthened  individual  data  rights,  data  breach  requirements,  limitations  on  data  retention,  strengthened  requirements  for  special  categories  ofpersonal\n data  and  pseudonymised  (i.e.,  key-coded)  data,  and  additional  obligations  for  contracting  with  service  providers  that  may  process  personal  data.

Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs andharming\n our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significantpenalties,\n including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Otherjurisdictions outside\n the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costsand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California \nConsumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers andnew\n operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020.

In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data withcertain\n government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,and\n ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictionsto\n suffer,  and  may  result  in  such  government  authorities  assessing  significant  fines  or  penalties  against  us  or  shutting  down  our  or  Careem\u2019s  app  on  either  atemporary\n or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computationsuch that we are unable to co\nmply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the mannerin which we provide our products and off\nerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.Such\n data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thuscompliance\n requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,disclosure,\n and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceivedfailure\n by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us byindividuals,\n consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, iffound\n liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity.If any of these events were \nto occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.Adverse\n litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit ourability to operate our business.\nWe\n have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legalproceedings\n by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others.

In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectivenessof\n our  internal  control  over  financial  annually.  We  currently  are  required  to  disclose  changes  in  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  have  materiallyaffected, or are reasonably li\nkely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.The\n process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly andchallenging,\n and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in sizeand\n complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline requiredfor a public company. During the \nevaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control overfinancial reporting, we \nwill be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.We\n cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growthofferings\n (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintaininternal\n control  over  financial  reporting  could  severely  inhibit  our  ability  to  accurately  report  our  financial  condition  or  operating  results.  If  we  are  unable  toconclude\n that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a materialweakness\n in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the marketprice\n of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SECor\n other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these andother effective control system\ns, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.ITEM 1B.

Theclaim\n alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value ofcertain\n taxi licenses.

We are focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 throughpreserving\n our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs. The pandemic hasreduced the demand for our Mobility offering globally, while accelerating the gro\nwth of our Delivery offerings. We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic bylaunching new, or expanding existing, s\nervices or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.To\n comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended our shared rides Mobility offering inmost\n markets, and implemented \u201cleave at door\u201d delivery options for Delivery offerings.

We also exited the JUMP business and incurred costsrelated\n to site closures, asset impairments and write-offs. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $362 million in total restructuringand\n related charges in the consolidated statement of operations. Total restructuring and related charges included $248 million of cash settled charges, primarily forseverance and other terminatio\nn benefits. The remaining costs related to these restructuring activities are expected to be immaterial.These\n activities  were  designed  to  generate  an  aggregate  cost  savings  of  at  least  $1.0  billion  annually  when  compared  to  our  original  fourth  quarter  2020planned cost structure, with the\n largest component of savings resulting from reductions in workforce. We do not believe these cost-saving measures will impair ourability\n to conduct any of our key business functions. As of December 31, 2021, we achieved these aggregate cost savings when compared to our original fourthquarter\n 2020 planned cost structure.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accountingestimate\n to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could havebeen\n used,  or  changes  in  the  accounting  estimates  that  are  reasonably  likely  to  occur  periodically,  could  materially  impact  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,liabilities, revenu\ne and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience andon\n various  other  assumptions  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,  the  results  of  which  form  the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  thecarrying\n values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to theinherent uncertainty invol\nved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.64", "start_char_idx": 3522, "end_char_idx": 6066, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bee31690-d4ba-4abe-baf4-7ad04d9ea108": {"__data__": {"id_": "bee31690-d4ba-4abe-baf4-7ad04d9ea108", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6e10e153-55eb-41eb-a139-36202c2fd10c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "hash": "12488fc65b4f54c709bd53ae71dbf0a476bff34e781611f07b15b8c609fdb3cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "070062eb-e50a-4fd3-884b-2bb2c94f44a4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fed77f9ed871febeb8c95cdf575e4521f8092f45b8499ace69f4e1506da4665a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of ourconsolidated\n financial  statements.

Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants withend-users\n to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and wehave no performance oblig\nation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Judgment\n is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-userand\n are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). Wehave\n concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Deliverytransactions.\n The  assessment  of  whether  we  are  considered  the  principal  or  the  agent  in  a  transaction  could  impact  the  accounting  for  certain  payments  andincentives provided to Drive\nrs and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In\n certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsettingagainst\n any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such,uncollected service fees for ca\nsh trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver Incentives\nWe\n offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided tocustomers\n are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the servicereceived. Incentives offered i\nn exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.End-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe\n offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriateclassification\n of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotionswhich are recorded as a r\neduction of revenue.Business Combinations\nWe\n allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimatedfair\n values.

We regularlyassess the likelihood of adve\nrse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.67", "start_char_idx": 3921, "end_char_idx": 6088, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c6ac645-fab9-4373-920b-77120e0b9558": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c6ac645-fab9-4373-920b-77120e0b9558", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d0d5922-364c-4e7b-a508-781b970ca0dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "hash": "c94808ea79aede470ff3bee41d413bef57be3d180b95ae91d0961639cb3d50ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5bcf7477-73e1-4ab1-a192-0fd22cc74f96", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "af49011505758d13d3062680ddb05c546c52abc5404c9f26bdeda1e8bb22ebe6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Insurance ReservesWe\n use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance  mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for thepotential\n liabilities  for  certain  risks,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  and  underinsured  motorist,  auto  physical  damage,  general  liability,  and  workers\u2019compensation.\n The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of theultimate\n unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but notreported\n as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim andloss\n experience.  In  addition,  we  use  assumptions  based  on  actuarial  judgment  related  to  claim  and  loss  development  patterns  and  expected  loss  costs,  whichconsider\n frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.  These  reserves  are  continually  reviewed  and  adjusted  as  experience  develops  and  newinformation becomes known. Adjustm\nents, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.All estimates\n of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of theinsurance\n claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual resultsdepend\n upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,and\n social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the nearterm from the estimated amounts.\nWhile management be\nlieves that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.Stock-Based Compensation\nWe\n have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members ofour\n board of directors and non-employees. The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees. The majority of our outstandingRSUs,\n as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition. A small portion of the awards containsservice-based vesting\n condition as well as performance-based vesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition for themajority\n of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of certain financialand operation metrics. Th\ne market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.We\n account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accountingstandards,\n which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We accountfor forfeitures when they o\nccur.We\n have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inp\nuts and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interestrates, expected stock pr\nice volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.These assumptions used in the Black\n-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\u2022\nExpected term.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe\n are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currencyrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur\n exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The2025\n and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impactour\n consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis pointincrease or decrease in interest\n rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.The fair value of\n our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and decliningin\n periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 millionas of December 31, 2021.\nInvestment Risk\nOur\n investment  policy  objective  aims  to  preserve  capital  and  meet  liquidity  requirements  without  significantly  increasing  risk.  We  had  cash  and  cashequivalents including\n restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Wedid\n not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money marketfunds\n and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest raterisk.\n Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change ininterest rates would n\not have a material effect on our financial results.We\n are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates andrecently\n public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult tovalue\n given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk.These investments\n in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes inthe\n fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a setperiod of time afte\nr a public offering. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investments was $12.6 billion, including equity method investments.Foreign Currency Risk\nWe\n transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us tothe\n risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operatingexpenses\n denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  Accordingly,  changes  in  exchange  rates  may  negatively  affect  our  future  revenue  and  otheroperating\n results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar isdiversified across geogr\naphic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.We\n have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurementof our\n asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currencyrates\n may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter intoderivatives or other f\ninancial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.69", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4459, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25cb1be8-adb6-4acf-861c-2a410343eee0": {"__data__": {"id_": "25cb1be8-adb6-4acf-861c-2a410343eee0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ad0a05af-8850-4047-823c-45d080452588", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "hash": "b504c63a592ad5397c13286078864f313ad3cdc03c944c5a480e7cf5b21c19f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "ITEM 8.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.As\n described in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded The Drizly Group, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d) and TupeloParent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 3\n1, 2021 because they were acquired by the Company inpurchase\n business combinations during 2021. We have also excluded Drizly and Transplace from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Drizly andTransplace\n are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management\u2019s assessment and our audit of internal control overfinancial\n reporting collectively represent approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the yearended December 31, 2021.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Repor\ntingA\n company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation\n of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately an\nd fairly reflect the transactionsand\n dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (ii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financialstatements in accordance with\n generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance withauthorizations of management\n and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding71", "start_char_idx": 3733, "end_char_idx": 6274, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0408a5e4-68da-4a6e-ad93-8b65e8bf841a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0408a5e4-68da-4a6e-ad93-8b65e8bf841a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f083db98-717a-4f9a-8a96-9a2c5567c151", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "hash": "258b6a2947409ee34d9ee5bc1d6a939ab22efdc75c4aacbb03c16f12dc8360be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "99d50c30-99f0-4f9f-8b5a-6191c50c9139", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "31310e9ea6e543038c10824e2f9b2f6b717d606785a86bbbec274d5d58eb4605", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because\n of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness\n to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur\nes may deteriorate.Critical Audit Matters\nThe\n critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicatedor\n required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and(ii)\n involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe\n consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on thecritical audit matters or on the\n accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Presentation of Mobility and De\nlivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-UsersAs\n described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of theCompany\u2019s\n platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged toend-users\n for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal oragent\n in  transactions  with  Drivers,  Merchants  and  end-users.  This  determination  impacts  the  presentation  of  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis  as  well  as  thepresentation\n of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the yearended\n December  31,  2021,  the  Company\u2019s  Mobility  and  Delivery  revenue,  net  of  incentives,  was  $15.3  billion  and  discounts,  loyalty  programs,  promotions,refunds, and credits provided \nto end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.The\n principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, includingincentives,\n discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing thepresentation\n of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,which\n in  turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  whethertransaction attributes were a\nppropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing\n the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.\n These procedures  included testing  the effectiveness  of controls  relating  to the Company\u2019s revenue recognition  process, including  controls over thepresentation of Mobility \nand Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, triptransaction attributes\n and assessing management\u2019s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driverstatements,\n rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue andincome statement classification.\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\nAs\n described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which representsthe estimate of\n the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amountfor\n losses  incurred  but  not  reported  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.  The  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaid  obligation  utilizes  generally  accepted  actuarial  methodsapplied\n to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss developmentpatterns\n and  expected  loss  costs,  which  consider  frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4991, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99d50c30-99f0-4f9f-8b5a-6191c50c9139": {"__data__": {"id_": "99d50c30-99f0-4f9f-8b5a-6191c50c9139", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f083db98-717a-4f9a-8a96-9a2c5567c151", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "hash": "258b6a2947409ee34d9ee5bc1d6a939ab22efdc75c4aacbb03c16f12dc8360be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0408a5e4-68da-4a6e-ad93-8b65e8bf841a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "hash": "a42aef001a0909d0a516953252b211753f85cd17b8e34e775867c003b27f5480", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Valuation of Insurance Reserves\nAs\n described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which representsthe estimate of\n the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amountfor\n losses  incurred  but  not  reported  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.

Business\nUber\n Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber isa\n technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.Uber\n develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connectsconsumers\n (\u201cRider(s)\u201d)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (\u201cMobility  Driver(s)\u201d)  for  ridesharing  services,  and  connects  Riders  and  other  consumers(\u201cEaters\u201d)\n with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively,  \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery andother\n delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred toas\n \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and productexpertise to connect shipp\ners with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.Our\n technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe\n accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States(\u201cGAAP\u201d).\n We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d)where\n we  are  deemed  to  be  the  primary  beneficiary.  Refer  to  Note  16  \u2013  Variable  Interest  Entities  for  further  information.  All  intercompany  balances  andtransactions have been e\nliminated.Use of Estimates\nThe preparation\n of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect thereported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, an\nd other assumptions whichmanagement\n believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values ofinvestments\n and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value ofacquired\n intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;certain\n deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actualresults could\n differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supportingcertain\n of  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments,  in  particular,  our  impairment  assessment  related  to  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of  certaininvestments\n and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the globalfinancial\n markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operationsand financial perfor\nmance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit Risk\nCash\n and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject tocredit\n risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government andagency\n securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution orcommercial\n issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high creditquality.\n We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of fundswithheld\n by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4965, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35593aa8-9d95-41b6-a67b-8c99f4250bc4": {"__data__": {"id_": "35593aa8-9d95-41b6-a67b-8c99f4250bc4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d8b41c18-ae04-494b-8c1b-deed27136e1d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "hash": "85aae4d5332a793f48361bdb5691caee3e777b712c1c1478497bb6dceaec7166", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e59d37bd-aed0-4e36-a63c-91116e4f2993", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "hash": "ee1906c5d196bef9e0df852b32e1489acd6d67f9620c98ccf4b435a824557512", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government andagency\n securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities.

COVID-19  has  rapidly  impacted  market  and  economicconditions globally. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented\n, including business activities and travelrestrictions,\n and  \u201cshelter-at-home\u201d  orders,  that  have  had  an  adverse  impact  on  our  business  and  operations  by  reducing,  in  particular,  the  global  demand  forMobility\n offerings,  while  accelerating  the  growth  of  our  Delivery  offerings.

The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely onfuture\n developments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be furtherresurgences of the\n outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financialmarkets;\n governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behavior, all ofwhich are highly uncertain \nand cannot be predicted.Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash\n and  cash equivalents  consist  of  cash held  in checking  and savings  accounts  as  well as  investments  in  money market  funds, commercial  paper,  U.S.government\n and  agency  securities,  and  corporate  bonds.

Impairment indicators might include,but\n would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, asignificant\n adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell,or\n a  completed  auction  process  for  the  same  or  similar  securities  for  an  amount  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  those  securities.

Evidence of a loss in value might include, butwould\n not  necessarily  be  limited  to,  absence  of  an  ability  to  recover  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investment  or  inability  of  the  investee  to  sustain  an  earningscapacity\n that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financialresults\n and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect thevalue of our investments.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment\nWe\n evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amountof\n an asset or asset group (collectively, the \u201casset group\u201d) may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carryingamount\n of  such  asset  groups  to  the  future  undiscounted  cash  flows  it  expects  the  asset  group  to  generate.  If  we  consider  the  asset  group  to  be  impaired,  theimpairment to be re\ncognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\nFair\n value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe\n measurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used tomeasure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest pri\nority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and thelowest priority to unobservabl\ne inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:    Level 1    Observable inputs such as quot\ned prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level\n 2    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that arenot active or inputs \nother than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3    Unobservable inputs in which th\nere is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Our\n primary  financial  instruments  include  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  receivables,  investments,  accounts  payable,  accruedliabilities, long-t\nerm debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants. The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accountsreceivable,\n accounts  payable  and accrued  liabilities  approximates  their  carrying  value  due to the short-term  maturities  of these instruments.

These evaluations are complex,involve judgment, and the use\n of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors.

The MSA defines the service fee we chargeDrivers\n and Merchants for each transaction.

A contract exists between usand the Drivers and Merchants \nafter the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 ability to cancel the transaction lapses.The\n Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitat\ne the completion of a successful transaction.In\n 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets. In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation toDrivers,\n we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a trip iscomplete.\n We  present  revenue  on  a  net  basis  for  these  transactions,  as  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  by  Drivers  to  end-users.  For  the  years  endedDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized \ntotal revenue of $323 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.Additionally,\n during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for deliveryservices to end-users in those\n markets. We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contractsshall\n be recognized separately for each under ASC 606. We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term,which\n represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-usersof\n $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions.

New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a varietyof\n modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (\u201cNew Mobility\u201d). Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We wereresponsible for\n providing access to the e-bikes and e-scooters over the user\u2019s desired period of use. We recorded lease payments received upon completion of eachtrip.\n After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.Refer to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures fo\nr further information on the JUMP Divestiture.Advanced Technologies Group (\u201cATG\u201d) and Other Technology Programs Collaboration Rev\nenueIn\n 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next\u2013generation self-driving technology. Under thiscollaboration\n agreement, we received cash consideration over the three-year term. We have applied ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements for recognition andpresentation of the consid\neration received as collaboration revenue. Refer to Note 17 \u2013 Non-Controlling Interests for further information.Incentives to Customers\nIncentives\n provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fairvalue\n of  the  good  or  service  received.  Incentives  to  customers  that  are  not  provided  in  exchange  for  a  distinct  good  or  service  are  evaluated  as  variableconsideration,\n in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Sinceincentives are earn\ned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.Incentives earned by customers for referring\n new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. Weexpense\n such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient underASC\n 340-40-25-4  and  expense  costs  to  acquire  new  customer  contracts  as  incurred  because  the  amortization  period  would  be  one  year  or  less.  The  amountrecorded\n as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is establishedusing\n amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31,2019, 2020 and 2021 were immateria\nl.In\n some  transactions,  incentives  and  payments  made  to  customers  may  exceed  the  revenue  earned  in  the  transaction.  In  these  transactions,  the  resultingshortfall amount is re\ncorded as a reduction of revenue.Advertising Revenue\nWe\n derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform.Advertising revenue is recognized\n when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks.

The market-bas\ned conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.For\n market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions includingexpected\n stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event, and expected capital raise percentage. We estimate thevolatility\n of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in itsindustry group.\n We estimate the expected term based on various exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect atthe\n time of grant. Prior to our IPO in May 2019, we estimated the expected date of a qualifying event based on third-party valuations of our common stock andestimated the expected capital raise\n percentage based on management's expectations at the time of measurement of the award's value.We\n record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equity awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over therequisite\n service period, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied. We determine the requisite service period by comparingthe\n derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisiteservice period.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d)\nWe recognize stock-bas\ned expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2019 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period. The ESPP provides fortwelve-month\n offering  periods,  and  each  offering  period  includes  two  purchase  periods  of  approximately  six  months.  The  ESPP  allows  eligible  employees  topurchase\n shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price of either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date. We estimatethe\n fair  value  of  shares  to  be  issued  under  the  ESPP  based  on  a  combination  of  options  valued using  the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model.  In  2019,  wedetermine\n volatility over an expected term of six months based on our historical volatility and twelve months based on the average of our historical volatility andour\n peer group. In 2020 and 2021, we determine volatility over an expected term of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility. We estimatethe expected term based o\nn the contractual term.Common Stock Fair Value\nSubsequent to our IPO in May 2019, the fair va\nlue of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock.Prior\n to our IPO, the absence of an active market for our common stock required the Board of Directors, the members of which we believe have extensivebusiness,\n finance and venture capital experience, to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock-based awards and for calculatingstock-based\n compensation  expense.  We  obtained  contemporaneous  third-party  valuations  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in  determining  fair  value.  Thesecontemporaneous\n third-party  valuations  used  the  methodologies,  approaches  and  assumptions  consistent  with  the  American  Institute  of  Certified  PublicAccountants Practice Guide, \nValuation of Privately-Held -Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.

Actual resultsdepend upon\n the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claims settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,and\n social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when these amounts will be paid may vary from theestimate provided on the \nconsolidated balance sheets.Loss Contingencies\nWe\n are  involved  in  legal  proceedings,  claims,  and  regulatory,  indirect  tax  examinations  or  government  inquiries  and  investigations  that  may  arise  in  theordinary\n course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability whenwe\n believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible andthe loss or range of loss can be \nreasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the consolidated financial statements.94", "start_char_idx": 3892, "end_char_idx": 6219, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02005cdb-692c-44e7-98e8-0037f17b30ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "02005cdb-692c-44e7-98e8-0037f17b30ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7ed9c57b-cc2b-49c5-b37b-f9f7a4cec2d8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "hash": "9bf6017b447217e9f27fd6043f6d16998d77a0ff24bb55e47423d442365b1b8f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4b7d043c-af77-462b-b1c7-81ffca752b99", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "29a92b50cf42786215b3abffb6812f593f4de3cf0f500765e9ec310029d809d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters andrelated\n reasonably  possible  losses  disclosed.

This evaluation  consists of several factors  including, but not limited to, an assessment  of a significant adverse change in the economicenvironment,\n significant  adverse changes in the general  market  condition  of the geographies  and industries  in which our investees  operate,  and other publiclyavailable\n information that affect the value of our non-marketable equity securities. As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising fromCOVID-19,\n we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, wasless than their carry\ning value.To\n determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM,weighted\n at  80%  and  20%,  respectively.  The  CSE  method  assumes  an  if-converted  scenario,  where  the  OPM  approach  allocates  equity  value  to  individualsecurities\n within  the  investees\u2019  capital  structure  based  on  contractual  rights  and  preferences.  We  computed  a  range  of  market  adjustments  based  on  observedmarket\n valuation declines of Didi\u2019s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securitiesoccurred\n in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs areconsidered\n indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from thelatest\n financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us.A\n lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes ofallocating value in th\ne OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event wouldresult\n in  higher  valuation  (due  to  access  to  public  markets  and  reduction  in  cost  of  capital),  reduces  valuation  uncertainty,  and  generally  assumes  market  andmacro-economic\n conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario.

Call Option\nThe\n MLU B.V.

Call Option is $193 million, including the recognition of an immaterial gain for the fair value change duringthe\n year ended December 31, 2021. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulatedmultiple\n scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were underlyingbusiness value, option term of 1.7 y\nears, volatility of 50%, risk-free interest rates, and strike price (Level 3).MLU B.V. Basis Difference\nIncluded\n in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionateshare\n of the net assets of MLU B.V.

Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for currency translationadjustments represent\ning fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar.The table below provides the co\nmposition of the basis difference as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):As of December 31, 2021\nEquity method goodwill\n$ 545 Intangible assets, net \nof accumulated amortization54 Deferred tax liabilities\n(12) Cumulative currency tr\nanslation adjustments(107) Basis difference\n$ 480 We\n amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-line\n method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 4.0 years and 3.3 years as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Equitymethod\n goodwill is not amortized. The investment balance  is reviewed for impairment  whenever factors indicate  that the carrying value of the equity methodinvestment\n may not be recoverable.

We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, atour\n option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for atleast\n 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, andincluding,\n the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amountof the notes to be redeem\ned, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.The\n indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, theincurrence of indebtedn\ness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries.Prior\n to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recordedas\n equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liabilitycomponent\n (the \u201cdebt discount\u201d) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equitycomponent\n of  the  2025  Convertible  Notes  was  included  in  additional  paid-in  capital  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  was  notremeasured\n as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes asof the pricing date, we used th\ne binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.Effective\n January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease toadditional paid-in capital\n of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to theopening\n accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021 interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 ConvertibleNotes as a single liabili\nty measured at its amortized cost.The\n fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are notactive, which is considered \na Level 2 valuation input.Senior Notes\nIn\n October 2018, we issued five-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $500 million due on November 1, 2023 (the \u201c2023 Senior Notes\u201d) and eight-year\n notes  with  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $1.5  billion  due  on  November  1,  2026  (the  \u201c2026  Senior  Notes\u201d)  in  a  private  placement  offering  totaling  $2.0billion.\n We issued the 2023 and 2026 Senior Notes at par and paid approximately $9 million for debt issuance costs.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4139, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf5be81f-8338-4ad0-93d7-49ca05859396": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf5be81f-8338-4ad0-93d7-49ca05859396", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6cd32d51-1460-4061-97bf-b304cb744bd3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "hash": "216422f5d13e317af5690d893cfd711e07c34bd87fbc08893a1e9c56ee7b3aeb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7e569a1-89df-42d9-bf3c-64420ec8cc1f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-06-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-15"}, "hash": "23c1369482e2a1f6e03d3ff8794a29425c8fb4121080cb602f2ea85e6ef54b96", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We issued the 2023 and 2026 Senior Notes at par and paid approximately $9 million for debt issuance costs.

Upon closingof\n the IPO: (i) all shares of our outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 905 million shares of common stock; (ii) holdersof\n the 2021 and 2022 Convertible Notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into 94 million shares of common stock; and, (iii) an outstanding warrant whichbecame\n exercisable upon the closing of the IPO was exercised to purchase 0.2 million shares of common stock.

In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferredtax\n assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporarydifferences\n and  tax  planning  strategies  by  jurisdiction.  Our  judgment  regarding  future  profitability  may  change  due  to  many  factors,  including  future  marketconditions\n and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred taxassets,\n our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferredtax\n assets  of  $13.4  billion  and  $13.9  billion  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2021,  respectively.  In  2021,  the  increase  in  the  valuation  allowance  was  primarilyattributable\n to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations,and\n tax  credits  generated  during  the  year,  offset  partially  by  the  release  of  the  valuation  allowance  due  to  deferred  tax  liabilities  recorded  as  a  result  of  theacquisitions providing an addi\ntional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.The\n indefinite  carryforward  period  for  net  operating  losses  (\"NOLs\")  means  that  indefinite-lived  deferred  tax  liabilities  can  be  considered  as  support  forrealization of deferred tax assets, which can\n affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.

For the period from July 6, 2020through December 31, 2020, CS-Global contribu\nted an immaterial amount of revenue and loss before taxes.In December 2020, we received \napproval from Mexico\u2019s antitrust regulator to complete the CS-Mexico transaction. On January 11, 2021, CS-Global exercisedthe\n call option through the CS-Mexico Put/Call agreement and acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico, and we owned 55% of CS-Mexicothrough\n our  ownership  in  CS-Global.  The  acquisition  of  CS-Mexico  was  accounted  for  as  a  business  combination.  The  acquisition  date  fair  value  of  theconsideration\n transferred for CS-Mexico was immaterial, and consisted of a combination of cash payment and equity payment in Uber common stock and the fairvalue\n of  the  CS-Mexico  Put/Call  remeasured  at  the  acquisition  date.  As  a  result  of  remeasuring  our  prior  CS-Mexico  Put/Call  held  immediately  prior  to  thebusiness\n combination, we recognized an immaterial loss during the year ended December 31, 2021. The loss was included in other income (expense), net in theconsolidated statemen\nt of operations.In\n August  2021,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of  the  remaining  45%  ownership  interest  in  Cornershop  (or  47%,  on  a  fully-diluted  basis)  in  an  all-stocktransaction.\n As consideration for our acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest, we issued 25 million shares of our common stock, including 4.6 millionrestricted\n shares  issued  to  certain  Cornershop  employees.  In  addition,  we  issued  4  million  stock  options  to  replace  assumed  outstanding  stock  options.  Thesereplacement stock opt\nions attributable to post-acquisition service are included in our option activity and are recognized as stock-based compensation expense.The\n acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. Accordingly, we did not recognize again\n or loss in our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2021. In connection with this acquisition, the previously recognizednon-controlling interes\nt was derecognized. Following this transaction, Cornershop became our wholly-owned subsidiary.The total purchase\n price was determined to be $967 million, based on the number of shares issued and Uber\u2019s share price on the closing date. The fair value ofthe\n 4.6 million restricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees was determined to be $202 million. These shares are restricted and contingent on theemployees\u2019\n continuing employment at the combined company for the next three years. These restricted shares are considered compensation for post-combinationservices and will be recogn\nized as stock-based compensation expense ratably over the next three years.Postmates\nOn\n July 5, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire 100% ownership interest in Postmates, an on-demand delivery platform in theU.S.\nOn\n December 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Postmates, bringing together our global Mobility and Delivery platform with Postmates\u2019 distinctivedelivery\n business  in  the  U.S.  As  a  result  of  the  transaction,  we  obtained  ownership  interest  in  Postmates  through  our  voting  rights,  and  the  transaction  wasaccounted\n for  as a  business  combination.

CONTROLS AND\n PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe\n maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that wefile\n or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timeperiods\n specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,including our\n Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule13a-15(b)\n under  the  Exchange  Act,  our  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  ourdisclosure\n controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief ExecutiveOfficer\n and  Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that,  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  our  disclosure  controls  andprocedures are effective at a reas\nonable assurance level.Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes to\n our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected,or are reasonably likely t\no materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur\n management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controlover financial repor\nting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, ourmanagement\n does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.Any control system,\n no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that itsobjectives\n will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all controlissues and instances of fraud, \nif any, within our company have been detected.Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur\n management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under theExchange\n Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in\u201cInternal\n Control - Integrated Framework\u201d (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Based on thatassessment,\n our  management  has  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  December  31,  2021.  In  addition,PricewaterhouseCoopers\n LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting asof December 31, 2021. You can find the fu\nll text of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP attestation report in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In\n accordance with guidance from the staff of the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control overfinancial reporting\n for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our management\u2019s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded theinternal\n control activities of The Drizly Group, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d), which we acquired in October 2021 and Tupelo Parent, Inc.
