**Time:** 10:30 - 11:10

**Called By:** Ashley Williamson (Staff)
**Attendees:** Ashley Williamson (Staff), Aboze Brain John (Student)

**Hours spent on project since first meeting:** 80

**Brief description of work since last meeting:**
- Conducted research on supervised fine-tuning and instruct tuning, as well as data curation for fine-tuning.
- Explored the Retrieval Augmented Fine Tuning (RAFT) technique for generating datasets using OpenAI models to create question and answer pairs within the RAG pipeline.
- Investigated the implementation of open-source tools for fine-tuning, specifically Axolotl (https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl).
- Conducted experiments with agentic models.

**Issues identified:**
- Management of research papers.
- Computation and cost resources required for the fine-tuning workflow.
- Challenges with embedding and query model mismatches.

**Agreed tasks for next meeting:**
- Continue working on the agentic side of the project using open-source models or GPT-3.5 Turbo.
- Utilize Zotero for managing research papers.
- Prepare a basic draft of the literature review, understanding that it will evolve with project development.

**Next meeting**
- Date: 2024-06-28
- Time: TBD
