# Compliance Report for BRD Draft

## 1. Compliance Analysis
The BRD draft for the Emotional Surveillance App has been assessed for GDPR compliance. The following key areas were evaluated:
   - **User Consent**: The app must obtain free, specific, and informed consent from users before collecting or processing their emotional data. This consent should be obtained prior to or at the time of installation.
   - **Data Transparency**: The app must clearly explain what data is being collected, how it will be used, and the rights of users regarding their data.
   - **User Rights**: Users should be able to access, modify, or delete their data. The app must ensure the right to access personal data, obtain corrections, and the right to be forgotten.
   - **Data Protection**: Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect user data. This includes encryption, pseudonymisation, and anonymisation where applicable.
   - **Advertisements**: Ensure advertisements are clearly authorized by users. If using contextual ads without sharing personal data, users must be able to opt-out. For targeted ads involving health data processing, obtain explicit consent separately.
   - **Children's Data**: Obtain parental consent for users under 16 (or as per national laws, which may lower the age to 13 or 14).

## 2. DPIA Report
The Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) identifies potential data privacy risks and mitigation strategies:
   - **Risk 1: Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data**
     - Mitigation: Implement strong encryption protocols, regular security audits, and access controls.
   - **Risk 2: Inadequate User Consent**
     - Mitigation: Develop a clear and user-friendly consent mechanism, ensuring users understand what they are consenting to.
   - **Risk 3: Data Breach**
     - Mitigation: Establish a robust incident response plan, regularly update security measures, and conduct employee training on data privacy.
   - **Risk 4: Misuse of Data for Advertisements**
     - Mitigation: Obtain explicit consent for targeted ads, provide opt-out options for contextual ads, and ensure compliance with national advertising laws.

## 3. Compliance Strategy
   - **Data Mapping**: Conduct comprehensive data mapping to understand data flow and storage within the app.
   - **Privacy by Design**: Integrate data protection measures into the development process from the outset.
   - **Regular Audits**: Perform regular compliance audits to ensure ongoing adherence to GDPR.
   - **User Education**: Educate users about their rights and how their data is being used through transparent privacy policies and in-app notifications.
   - **Documentation**: Maintain thorough documentation of all compliance measures, including consent forms, data protection policies, and DPIA reports.

## 4. Documentation
The following documents should be maintained to demonstrate GDPR adherence:
   - **Data Protection Policy**: Outlining the app's approach to data privacy and protection.
   - **Consent Forms**: Records of user consent for data collection and processing.
   - **DPIA Reports**: Detailed assessments of data privacy risks and mitigation strategies.
   - **Privacy Policy**: Clear and comprehensive policy explaining data collection, usage, and user rights.
   - **Security Protocols**: Documentation of encryption methods, access controls, and incident response plans.
