   - **Mitigation:** Encrypt data at rest and in transit, conduct regular security audits, and implement an incident response plan.

3. **Risk: Inaccurate Data Entry**
   - **Mitigation:** Validate all user inputs and enforce data accuracy measures.

4. **Risk: Insecure Data Reporting**
   - **Mitigation:** Secure report generation and export processes, ensuring data is protected during these operations.

### Compliance with GDPR Articles:
- **Article 5:** Data processing principles, including data accuracy and integrity.
- **Article 12:** Transparent information, communication, and modalities for exercising user rights.
- **Article 32:** Security of processing, including technical and organizational measures to ensure data security.

### Measures and Procedures:
1. **Data Encryption**
   - Encrypt all personal data at rest and in transit.
   - Ensure encryption keys are securely managed.

2. **Regular Updates and Patching**
   - Implement a regular update and patching schedule to mitigate security vulnerabilities.

3. **Audit Logs**
   - Maintain detailed audit logs of all data access and modifications.

4. **User Consent Management**

5. **Data Breach Response Plan**
   - Develop and implement a detailed data breach response plan in accordance with GDPR Article 33.
   - Ensure timely notification of data subjects and authorities in the event of a breach.

### Contingency Plans:
- **For Resource Allocation Issues:**
  - Regularly review resource allocation and make adjustments as needed to prevent overallocation or underutilization.
  - Maintain a buffer in the project budget to accommodate additional resources if necessary.

- **For Delays in Deliverables:**
  - Implement a robust communication plan to keep stakeholders informed of any delays and the steps being taken to address them.
  - Develop alternative strategies to catch up on lost time, such as parallel processing of tasks where possible.
