Compliance Report for BRD Draft

1. Compliance Analysis:

The Emotion Surveillance Mobile Application, as described in the Business Requirements Document (BRD) draft, raises significant GDPR compliance concerns due to its use of facial recognition technology and processing of sensitive personal data. Key areas of concern include:

a) Legal Basis for Processing: The application must have a valid legal basis for processing personal data under Article 6 of GDPR. Given the sensitive nature of emotion detection, explicit consent (Article 9) may be required.

b) Data Minimization: The application must ensure that only necessary data is collected and processed, adhering to the principle of data minimization (Article 5(1)(c)).

c) Purpose Limitation: The use of collected data must be strictly limited to the specified purposes (Article 5(1)(b)).

d) Special Category Data: Biometric data used for identifying individuals is considered special category data under Article 9, requiring additional safeguards.

e) Automated Decision-Making: If the application makes automated decisions based on emotion detection, it must comply with Article 22, including the right to human intervention.

f) Data Subject Rights: The application must facilitate data subject rights, including the right to access, rectification, erasure, and objection (Articles 15-21).

2. DPIA Report:

A Data Protection Impact Assessment is mandatory for this project due to the large-scale processing of special category data and systematic monitoring of public areas. Key risks identified include:

a) Privacy Intrusion: Continuous emotion surveillance may infringe on individuals' right to privacy.
b) Data Accuracy: Emotion recognition algorithms may produce inaccurate results, leading to unfair treatment.
c) Function Creep: Data collected for one purpose may be misused for other, unauthorized purposes.
d) Data Security: Large-scale collection of biometric data presents a significant security risk if breached.
e) Discrimination: Emotion analysis could lead to discriminatory practices in areas like employment or marketing.

Mitigation Strategies:
- Implement strong encryption and access controls for all collected data.
- Develop clear policies on data retention and deletion.
- Ensure transparency in emotion detection processes and allow for human oversight.
- Regularly audit and test the accuracy of emotion recognition algorithms.
- Implement strict purpose limitation controls to prevent unauthorized data use.

3. Compliance Strategy:

To ensure ongoing GDPR compliance, the following strategy should be implemented:

a) Data Protection by Design and Default: Incorporate privacy features from the outset of the application development (Article 25).
b) Consent Management: Develop a robust system for obtaining and managing user consent, including easy withdrawal options.
c) Data Minimization: Implement technical measures to ensure only necessary data is collected and processed.
d) Transparency: Provide clear, concise privacy notices explaining how data is collected, used, and protected.
e) Security Measures: Implement state-of-the-art security measures to protect personal data (Article 32).
f) Data Subject Rights Management: Develop processes to handle data subject requests efficiently.
g) Data Protection Officer: Appoint a DPO to oversee GDPR compliance (Article 37).
h) Vendor Management: Ensure all third-party vendors comply with GDPR requirements.
i) Regular Audits: Conduct periodic compliance audits and update practices as necessary.

4. Documentation:

To demonstrate GDPR adherence, the following documentation should be maintained:

a) Privacy Policy: A comprehensive policy detailing all aspects of data processing.
b) Data Processing Register: A record of all data processing activities (Article 30).
c) Consent Records: Documentation of all obtained user consents.
d) Data Protection Impact Assessment: Detailed DPIA report and ongoing updates.
e) Data Breach Response Plan: Procedures for detecting, reporting, and investigating data breaches.
f) Data Retention Schedule: Clear timelines for data retention and deletion.
g) Employee Training Records: Documentation of staff training on data protection.
h) Data Subject Request Procedures: Detailed processes for handling various data subject rights.
i) Vendor Agreements: Contracts with third-party processors ensuring GDPR compliance.
