Compliance Report for BRD Draft: Emotion Detection and Recognition (EDR) Mobile Application

1. Compliance Analysis

The EDR Mobile Application project raises several significant GDPR compliance concerns due to its nature and the type of data it processes. Key areas of concern include:

a) Processing of Special Category Data: The application processes biometric data (facial expressions, voice tone) and potentially health data (physiological information), which are considered special category data under GDPR Article 9. Processing such data requires explicit consent and additional safeguards.

b) Data Collection and Processing: The app collects and processes personal data in real-time, including facial images, voice recordings, and physiological data. This raises concerns about the scope and necessity of data collection, as well as the legal basis for processing.

c) Data Subject Rights: The real-time nature of data processing may pose challenges in fully implementing data subject rights, such as the right to erasure or the right to object to processing.

d) Data Security: Given the sensitivity of the data being processed, robust security measures are crucial to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, or misuse of personal data.

e) Cross-border Data Transfers: If the app is available internationally, there may be issues related to cross-border data transfers, especially if data is processed outside the EEA.

f) Profiling and Automated Decision-Making: The app's emotion recognition features may fall under GDPR's provisions on profiling and automated decision-making, requiring additional safeguards and possibly human intervention.

2. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) Report

A DPIA is mandatory for this project due to the large-scale processing of special category data and the use of new technologies. Key elements of the DPIA include:

a) Purpose of Processing: To provide real-time emotion detection and recognition services to users.

b) Necessity and Proportionality: Assess whether the processing of biometric and physiological data is necessary and proportionate to the app's objectives. Consider data minimization strategies.

c) Risks to Data Subjects:
   - Privacy intrusion due to continuous monitoring of emotions
   - Potential for misuse of sensitive personal data
   - Risk of inaccurate emotion recognition leading to incorrect profiling
   - Vulnerability to data breaches due to the sensitive nature of data

d) Risk Mitigation Measures:
   - Implement strong encryption for data in transit and at rest
   - Develop strict access controls and authentication mechanisms
   - Implement regular security audits and penetration testing
   - Provide clear user controls for data sharing and emotion tracking

e) Residual Risks: Assess any remaining risks after mitigation measures are implemented and determine if they are acceptable given the benefits of the application.

3. Compliance Strategy

To ensure GDPR compliance, the following strategy should be implemented:

a) Legal Basis: Obtain explicit consent from users for processing their biometric and physiological data. Consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.

b) Privacy by Design and Default: Incorporate privacy considerations into every aspect of the app development process. Implement data minimization, purpose limitation, and storage limitation principles.

c) Transparency: Develop a clear and comprehensive privacy policy that explains in simple terms how the app collects, processes, and protects user data. Include information on data subject rights and how to exercise them.

d) Data Subject Rights: Implement mechanisms to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights, including access, rectification, erasure, and data portability.

e) Data Protection Officer (DPO): Appoint a DPO to oversee GDPR compliance and serve as a point of contact for data subjects and supervisory authorities.

f) International Data Transfers: If applicable, ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for transferring data outside the EEA, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or adequacy decisions.

g) Data Processor Agreements: Ensure all third-party service providers (e.g., cloud storage providers) have appropriate data processing agreements in place.

h) Breach Notification Procedures: Develop and implement a data breach response plan to ensure timely notification to supervisory authorities and affected individuals.

4. Documentation

To demonstrate GDPR adherence, the following documentation should be
