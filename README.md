# Masters Project: Fine-tuning Open-source LLM for Multi-Agent Software Requirement Analysis and Specification

## Project Overview

### Aim
The project aims to develop and fine-tune an open-source large language model (LLM) to automate and enhance the software requirement analysis and specification process using a multi-agent system

### Research Question
How can LLMs be fine-tuned and utilized within a multi-agent system to automate and enhance the software requirement analysis and specification process in project development?

### Objectives
1. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Collect and preprocess datasets on business analysis, software requirements, UK regulations, and ethics.
2. **Fine-tuning**
   - Fine-tune an open-source LLM on the prepared datasets (Susnjak et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024).
3. **Build Multi-Agent System**
   - Develop an agents system specializing in requirements (He et al., 2023).
4. **Deployment of the System**
   - Deploy the multi-agent system (Pillai and Thakur, 2024).
5. **Human Evaluation**
   - Conduct human evaluation using the Likert scale (Nemoto and Beglar, 2014).

### Practical Outcomes
- Curate and prepare datasets for domain-specific LLM fine-tuning.
- Customize the LLM based on the prepared dataset.
- Develop an agent system for requirement extraction, classification, analysis, validation, and specification.
- Perform a comprehensive assessment of system performance and gather user feedback.
- Write and submit a dissertation report.
